# Vital Signs Simulation During Anesthesia: a Deep Learning Approach
Project submited to EMBC 2020
We proide the code and the results obtained on the dataset provided by the article.
Also, we provide the artificial neural networks parameters for testing.

## Abstract:


In the past years, promising results have been obtained by machine learning techniques in attempts of anesthesia automatization. The most recent study by Lee et al. demonstrated that machine learning performed better than target-controlled infusion (TCI) in predicting hypnosis level measured by Bispectral Index (BIS) values. In the present work, we aimed to reach acceptable accuracy of vital signs prediction during anesthesia using convolutional neural networks and an open vital sign database. BIS values, heart rate (HR), mean blood pressure (MBP), propofol, and remifentanil infusion rates were used for BIS, HR, and MBP prediction during anesthesia. This work accomplished an acceptable prediction of all three vital signs.
When comparing to previous studies, similar error metrics were achieved, resulting in the acceptable generation of BIS values, heart rate and mean blood pressure, for the most of the cases, with a different artificial neural network method for function approximation.
